## Why Free Tools Friday?

Here's why FTF exists — in our words, not marketing speak:

Why we release free tools every Friday — and why it's worth paying attention.

MSPs deal with real problems, real pressure, and not a lot of extra time.

So here's the truth:

Most tools in our industry are either overpriced, overcomplicated, or overhyped.

And too often, you have to talk to three people and hand over your email just to find out if something even works.

We're not doing that.

Free Tools Friday (#FTF) is simple:

Useful tools. Real problems solved. No hoops. No paywalls. Every Friday.

That's it.
